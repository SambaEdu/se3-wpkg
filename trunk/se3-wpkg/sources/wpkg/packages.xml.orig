<!-- Available package database.

     This is a list of all packages that can be deployed to workstations.
     
     Each package has the following attributes:
     
        id          A unique identifier representing the package. Should be
                    short and to the point.
                
        name        Longer textual description of the package. This should be
                    the full product name.
                
        revision    User created integer to represent the "version" of the
                    specific package. Should be incremented when creating a new
                    release.
                    
        reboot      If "true" system reboots when done installing, removing or
                    upgrading the package.
                    
        priority    Specifies a numeric value that determines in what order a
                    package will be installed.
                    
    The following additional elements can or must be included within a package:
    
        depends     Specifies that this package depends on another package and
                    optionally version. Either that package must be installed or
                    must be installable.
    
        install     Contains command(s) to be run when the package is to be
                    installed.
                    
        remove      Contains command(s) to be run when the package is to be
                    removed.
                    
        upgrade     Contains commands(s) to be run when the package is already
                    installed, but the new revision number is greater than the
                    old revision number.
                    
        env         Sets an environmental variable to the specified value 
		    (not yet implemented).

	Three check conditions: "registry" (checks the registry), "file" (checks for a presence of a file)
	and "uninstall" - checks in Software Add/Remove.
	This means: if the "registry" condition is not met (i.e., the specified registry entry doesn't exist),
	or, "file" condition is not met (i.e., that file doesn't exist), or, "uninstall" condition is not met
	(i.e., software is not listed in Software Add/Remove), WPKG will try to execute "install cmd".
	After it's executed, WPKG will check the exit code (should be 0 in this example) *and* verify all the checks.
	If *any* of the checks is not met, software is considered *not* installed.
	So enter these values carefully!
	Remember that you don't have to specify all three check conditions, usually one of them is enough:
	if the software you are about to install will show up in Software Add/Remove, it is sufficient to specify just
	"uninstall" check.
