V 0.9.7-test2

Reboot behaviour more customizable (see rebootpatch.diff patch):

- without option /rebootcmd   -> normal behaviour

- with option /rebootcmd:special
  -> looks if it can find tools\psshutdown.exe (from Sysinternals) and uses the loop 
  from Frank Lee (introduced in 0.9.6)

- with option   /rebootcmd:wpkg\myshutdown.bat  _or_
  option   /rebootcmd:\\server\share\myshutdown.bat

Tue Jun 28 2005
-----------------------------
V 0.8-test2
  
* wpkg.js changes after 0.8-test1:

- small corrections in wpkg.js addressing wrong warnings in certain cases
- additional comments in hosts.xml



Sat Jun 18 2005
-----------------------------
V 0.8-test1
  
* wpkg.js changes after 0.7-test1:

- new functionality: you can execute scripts/programs once - useful for the tasks you want 
  to do one time only, like disk defragmenting, some testing, changing printers etc.
  
  <package execute="once">
  
  After that, this task will be added to wpkg.xml, and will not be executed again.
  

- hostname case is now ignored, you can use upper and lower case and it will work


- new flags:

/debug or /verbose - print everything WPKG does, useful for packet installation debugging (and for new users
which need to understand how WPKG works)

/dryrun - "simulates" packet installing, without installing anything



Sat Jun 11 2005
-----------------------------
V 0.7-test1
  
* wpkg.js changes after 0.6:

- regular expression support in hosts.xml!

You can view the exact syntax on this page:
    
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/jscript7/html/jsjsgrpregexpsyntax.asp
    
Quick examples:

<host name="b[0-9]+" profile-id="profile" />

works for:		b1, b10, b100
does not work for:	bubu, b, x, x1, x10, x100 


<host name=".+" profile-id="profile" />

works for *all* hosts - use with care (!), place at the bottom of hosts.xml


<host name="b.+" profile-id="profile1" />

works for "b10", "b11", "b12345" etc.


<host name="b.+" profile-id="profile2" />
<host name="bronek1" profile-id="profile1" />
<host name="bron.+" profile-id="profile3" />

Normally, hosts are parsed from top to the bottom, except when the hostname is not a regular expression.
So host "bronek1" will match "profile1", even though it also matches "b.+" and "bron.+" (which are regular expressions).


- new flags:

/force - Uses force when performing actions (ignores wpkg.xml).
Handy when you're not sure if your system is "up to date" with the state described in hosts.xml, packages.xml and
profiles.xml (i.e., when someone was adding / removing software by other means than WPKG).
It will "scan" your system for all possible packages from packages.xml, and then, install and/or uninstall
packages, according to profiles.xml / packages.xml / hosts.xml for a given host.


/forceInstall - Forces installation over existing packages.
The "install" command will be run, even if "check" conditions are met.

-----------------------------
  V 0.6

   * wpkg.js changes after 0.6-test1:

    - More examples in packages.xml on how to use new features


Wed Jun  8 2005
-----------------------------
  V 0.6-test1

   * wpkg.js changes:

    - Added new check type - it checks if the program is in "Software Add/Remove"
    
	An example entry looks like below:
      
	    <check type="uninstall" condition="exists" path="Filzip 3.02" />^

	In the path="" field you just have to add a name which is in Windows Software Add/Remove - and
	that's it: you no longer have to figure out the registry entries and/or files!
	
	Of course you can still use "file" and "registry" check types, combine them all etc. (all of them
	have to be met to consider software installed; they will be checked also *after* installation due
	to the fact that some installers don't handle exit codes properly).
	
	
    - Output during the installing looks like below:
    
        Checking presence of Filzip 3.02; uninstall check condition failed !
        Checking presence of Filzip 3.02; file check condition failed !
        Checking presence of Filzip 3.02; registry check condition failed !
        Installing Filzip 3.02...
        Checking presence of Filzip 3.02; uninstall check condition met.
        Checking presence of Filzip 3.02; file check condition failed !
        Checking presence of Filzip 3.02; registry check condition met.
	
      This can mean:
       - the installation was unsuccessful (and the package won't be written to
         %SYSTEM32%\wpkg.xml) because the file check condition was not met,
       - file check condition has a typo in packages.xml,
       - you don't have to use that many conditions - one "uninstall" check is often enough.
       
       
    - Changed double quotations to single quotations in packages.xml.
      Some installation instruction may require using double quotations.


Fri Jun  3 2005
-----------------------------
  V 0.5-test1
    
   * wpkg.js changes:
  
    - Fixed registry checking.
    - If there is no '<check type="...' entry for a given package, '<install cmd="...' will be
      executed each time the machine is booted. This is useful when one wants to execute certain scripts on each
      machine startup.
    - If there is more than one '<check type="...' (that is, "file" and "registry"), both of them have
      to be met to assume the package is installed (before it was OR - so it was any of them).
    - Added checking *after* installation, too. Some installers return exit code 0 (for example, SAS 9.1.3),
      even though the installation was unsuccessful. This prevents WPKG from writing such package to wpkg.xml
      in case it wasn't really installed.

   * other changes:
    
    - we have our own domain - wpkg.org :)
    - the documentation - which is now on http://wpkg.org - has been greatly improved since the last WPKG release
      (most of you probably noticed that long time ago)
    - some work has been done on a web interface to WPKG
